We have a tailor and a stylist on site to help you restyle your new finds. Trying to reduce our carbon foot print one stitch at a time.\nHow many clothes can our guest take?\nEvery clothing swap is different. If we receive more clothing than we expect, we can give away more. If a guest brings 3 pieces, they can take home 3. But if we start the event with a lot of clothing we can let our guest leave with more than what they came in with. \nWhy do we organize Clothing Swaps?\nThe purpose of a clothing swap is to inspire and educate our guests on textile waste. Every year the U.S. generates an average of 25 Billion pounds of textiles per year. That\u2019s about 82lbs per U.S. resident. Only 15% gets donated or recycled.\u00a0 These clothes go into landfills and decompose releasing methane which is a contributor to global warming\n","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/glitter-avenues-annual-clothing-swap-tickets-28870034049?aff=ebapi","start_time":"2016-11-20T14:00:00","end_time":"2016-11-20T19:00:00","status":"live","price":"","type":"","type2":"","image":"","feed":"Eventbrite Parties NYC"},{"name":"Le Souk Honey Dip Sundays Brunch & Day party SimmsMovement","description":"Come celebrate and join us each and every Sunday * HONEY DIP SUNDAYS (Brunch\/DayParty Series ) *#LeSouk @510 LaGuardia & Bleecker @2pm - 10pm @HH 2PM - 6PM @Brunch Till 6pm @ 35 2 HOURS MIMOSA' S, BELLINI'S OR SANGRIA + ENTREE @ 200 BOTTLE + HOOKAH @ 40 Pichers @Cover B4 6pm @LADIES FREE ALL NIGHT via EVENTBRITE @Music by DJ BLAZE NYC * DJ PRICE I RIGHT * #SIMMSMOVEMENT Costume Optional or Stylishly Chic #NYCNIGHTLIFE \u00a0 #Soca#Hiphop#ladiesnightout #Free #Dj#Music #Singlerelease #Food# #happyhour #Brunch #Party#Hookah#simmsmovement #hot97 #lesouk","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/le-souk-honey-dip-sundays-brunch-day-party-simmsmovement-tickets-29201549621?aff=ebapi","start_time":"2016-11-20T14:00:00","end_time":"2016-11-20T22:00:00","status":"live","price":"","type":"","type2":"","image":"","feed":"Eventbrite Parties NYC"},{"name":"Little Club Heads 80's Party","description":"Little Club Heads 80's Party\nTake a trip back to the 80's with Little Club Heads. 10 Year Old DJs Amira & Kayla Spins Classics From The 80's and Today's Hits, Live Performances, Best Dressed 80's contest, Dance Contest, Face Painting, Balloon Twisting, Hosted By Mr.Blue, and Appearances By Nubby & Bubby.\nTickets must be purchased in advance.","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/little-club-heads-80s-party-tickets-26309170437?aff=ebapi","start_time":"2016-11-20T14:00:00","end_time":"2016-11-20T17:00:00","status":"live","price":"","type":"","type2":"","image":"","feed":"Eventbrite Parties NYC"},{"name":"NYC Winter Coat Drive","description":"I've been wanting to do this for some time now and with the support of the awesome Ditmas Park & Brooklyn communities including Sycamore Brooklyn, Stems Brooklyn and Kandylion will be hosting a @NYcares #CoatDrive!Bring a coat, get a free drink!

She received her BFA from Colorado State University. She exhibits nationally in Juried and curated shows, such as: \u2018Figuratively Speaking\u2019 at the Brooklyn waterfront Artists Coalition juried by Lilly Wei, critic for both Art in America and Art News magazines; \u2018Visions in Clay\u2019 at the J Horton Gallery in Stockton, California juried by Judith Schwartz writer of Confrontational Ceramics; \u2018Beyond the Brickyard\u2019 at the Archie Bray Center for Ceramic Arts in Montana, and \u2018A Survey of Ceramic Figurative Art\u2019 at the Baltimore Clayworks juried by artist Adrian Arleo. She has been included in multiple publications including Ceramics Monthly magazine and Five Hundred Figures in Clay by Lark Press. Angelique has also been awarded multiple \u2018Best in Show\u2019 awards including Ceramics Annual of America in San Francisco juried by Suzanne Baiserman curator at the Oakland Museum of Art. Brickner was the winner of Van Der Plas Gallery\u2019s 2015 open call, Anthology. Her current. Solo exhibition Transparent Barriers: Phobias seeks to palpate the barriers created in intimate relationships by fear.\nOf her work for this exhibition, Brickner says, \u201c I am interested in the capacity of the human figure in art to relay and express these various psychological states, and it is my goal to have these compositions probe into the various psychological responses of the human experience to the fears that determine so much about our perceptions of what is true. I am fascinated by the impact our fears have on our inability to \u2018see\u2019 others and ourselves clearly.\u201d\nMuch of Brickner\u2019s work can be traced back to her youth in the Texas panhandle, and the isolation she felt growing up there. In this state of isolation, Bricker sought respite in her mother\u2019s coffee table books filled with the works of famous artists. She would copy their works over and over. Through this practice she became deeply inspired by Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoshka. This education by exclusion has remains extant within her portfolio.","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/transparent-barriers-tickets-28609552943?aff=ebapi","start_time":"2016-11-23T19:00:00","end_time":"2016-11-23T22:00:00","status":"live","price":"","type":"","type2":"","image":"","feed":"Eventbrite Parties NYC"},{"name":"Thanksgiving Eve Party ","description":"Join hundreds of folks at 5th&Mad for an unforgettable Thanksgiving Eve Party!\u00a0\nWe've got several DJ's confirmed, live performers and tons of giveaways for attendees.\u00a0\nDrink + bottle specials available all evening long.

The three-way interaction between the other man (THE BULL), the wife and the cuckold is what makes this so compelling, so taboo and so wrong its right... With modern cuckolding the husband is fully aware and tolerates his wife having sex with other men, often encouraging her to do so. The third party male is chosen primarily for his sexual prowess hence the term that is used to describe him... THE BULL\nTHE CUCKHOLD HUSBANDMany men fantasise about watching their partner make love with an attractive man and find they enjoy having a partner who is attractive to other men and who enjoys her sexuality.THE CUCKHOLDRESSShe will enjoy the dominance that expressing her sexuality with her chosen lover gives her over her husband. She will enjoy having her husband who supports her in her pursuit of quality sex and is selflessly committed to her. She has the best of all worlds - a husband who loves her and a proficient lover to see to her needs.","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/wednesday-cuck-and-bull-party-tickets-28654411115?aff=ebapi","start_time":"2016-11-23T21:00:00","end_time":"2016-11-24T02:00:00","status":"live","price":"","type":"","type2":"","image":"","feed":"Eventbrite Parties NYC"},{"name":"12th Annual Armenian Thanksgiving Eve Party\/Fundraiser","description":"NY\/NJ Metro Armenian Organizations to Host 12th Annual Collaborative\u00a0Thanksgiving Eve Party\u00a0\r\nPlease join us at Lexicon on Wednesday, November 23rd at 9:30pm.\r\nThe event will be hosted by:AGBU YPGNY, NY ASA, AYF-YOARF NJ Arsen & NY Hyortik Chapters, and\u00a0ARMNET-GNY\r\nKeeping in tune with the giving spirit of Thanksgiving, five Armenian organizations in the New York metropolitan area will be giving back to their patrons a wonderful night of dance and celebration.\r\nThe AGBU Young Professionals of Greater New York (AGBU YPGNY), Armenian Network-Greater New York Region, New York Armenian Students\u2019 Association (NY ASA) and Armenian Youth Federation-Youth Organization of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (AYF-YOARF) New York Hyortik and New Jersey Arsen Chapters cordially invite one and all to a Thanksgiving Eve party on Wednesday, November 23, 2016 at Lexicon.

We can't blame the youth, and we won't, but we will get together to heal.\n*RAIN DAY 11-25-16 at 2PM*\nThe Song Leader Mission is a tangible contribution to movement\u00a0building. The Song Leader Mission aims to address spiritual bankruptcy,\u00a0increase health and healing, create connectedness, reclaim birthrights to sound\u00a0healing and singing, re-introduce group singing as an essential frontline tool, and\u00a0establish the importance of The African world view and legacy to the planet.

Year after year, millions of people from around the globe flock to Manhattan to have a chance to get a glimpse of her, and now you'll have a chance to do so too. Lady Liberty is truly a spectacle, and if you're anything like the rest of country, you'll definitely want to pick the right voyage as you make your way toward her. There's where the Sunset Yacht comes in to play. Every Tuesday through Sunday this magnificent vessel gives you the chance to hope aboard and sail past some of the most memorable landmarks that the Big Apple has to offer. From the Manhattan, Williamsburg and Brooklyn Bridges, to South Street Seaport, Lower Manhattan, and the Freedom Tower, you'll have a chance to take all of these sites in as you cruise by. Last but certainly not least, will be the gorgeous Statue of Liberty, what's considered to be one of the top landmarks in the country. A live DJ will be supplying music to the all-ages crowd on board, so there will be some sounds that accompany the scenery. Presented by OnCruises.com, this voyage that departs from Pier 15 also features a full bar for the adults, so thirsts will be quenched!

Sure, NYC is known to have an overabundance of options, but after sticking to the same routine, time and time again, you also get fed up with going to the same places. Well, rather than making your Friday night as mundane as can be, we're giving you the opportunity to shake things up through this special cruise aboard one of the top vessels in Manhattan. Each and every Friday night hop aboard one of the Hornblower Yachts for their \"Rock the Yacht\" event. There phenomenal fleet features a state of the art sound system, full bar where you can order up your favorite cocktails, and a live DJ that will be putting that sound system to the test as you cruise around Manhattan and take in the best sights and sounds from the outside in. Friday's in the city are meant to be enjoyed, and if you look at your options, they're stunted to only include bars and nightclubs.\r\nDeparting from the brand new Pier 15 at South Street Seaport, it's the perfect place to take off from at 9PM. Get your tickets to this special event soon because you won't want to miss any of the action.\r\nBoarding: 8:30pm Departing: 9:00pm Returning: 12:00am\r\nAge Restriction: 21+\r\n* Prices are subject to increase\r\n","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/rock-the-yacht-friday-night-party-cruise-tickets-22126308384?aff=ebapi","start_time":"2016-11-25T20:30:00","end_time":"2016-11-26T00:00:00","status":"live","price":"","type":"","type2":"","image":"","feed":"Eventbrite Parties NYC"},{"name":"Black Friday & Album Listening Party for Asa Buchanon","description":"Come Out Dance, Two-step or Whatever\u00a0 you Like\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 with\n\" The Home Team \"\nRelaxed dress code,\n\nComplimentary\u00a0Admission,\n\nDrink specials,\nand Feel Good Muzic Provided\u00a0by:\n\nAsa Buchanon , DJ Music Mike, & \n\nSpecial Invited Guest DJ's\n\nThe Awesome 2\n\"Teddy Tedd & Special K\"\n\n\n'","url":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/black-friday-album-listening-party-for-asa-buchanon-tickets-28532261763?aff=ebapi","start_time":"2016-11-25T21:00:00","end_time":"2016-11-26T01:00:00","status":"live","price":"","type":"","type2":"","image":"","feed":"Eventbrite Parties NYC"},{"name":"East Village Pub Crawl \u2605","description":"\u2605 All ticket holders agree to the PCNY Terms of Use. Meeting location and detailed instructions confirmed after booking, and via email. \u2605\r\nQ: Why is the starting location confidential?\r\nA: This is for both quality control and crowd control. NYC bars (especially in neighborhoods like the Village) can easily become over-crowded so meeting details are only provided to confirmed bookings. \r\nQ: But is it close to my hotel? \r\nA: Probably. The East & West Village are very famous neighborhoods in Manhattan. No worries: all crawls begin and end within a couple blocks of major subway lines that run 24 hours a day, and also in high traffic areas with plenty of taxi cabs available all hours of the day & night. After all, it is the city that never sleeps!\u00a0\r\nQ: What does my $20 get me? \r\nA:\u00a0Admission to the #1 weekly party in New York CIty featuring: 4 of NYC's greatest hot-spots, free drinks & drink specials, 100% free admissions, like-minded people, awesome guides, and an unforgettable night out in NYC! \r\nQ: Is this good for solo travelers? \r\nA: Hellz yeah! It is very rare to not have solo travelers in attendance. \r\nQ: What are the bars like? \r\nA: Events begin in bars with a relatively calm atmosphere for registration & meet-and-greet, and then increase in intensity. \r\n\r\nQ: Is there transportation between the venues? \r\nA:\u00a0No. Some guests, however, take it upon themselves to hire a limousine to drive them around a bit before the crawl and then bring them to the first bar. \r\nQ: How many others will be attending?\r\nA: As many as we can fit, though we do have a limit.\u00a0\r\nQ: What time does the last venue close?\r\nA: 4:00 AM (and sometimes later).\r\nQ: What time do we arrive at the last venue?\r\nA: Approximately midnight.\r\nQ: How far do we walk between bars?\r\nA: The venues are very close to each other. About 3-5 minutes.\r\nQ: What if it is raining or snowing? \u2602\r\nA: Guests are encouraged to check the weather forecast beforehand, and prepare accordingly.\r\nQ: Can I arrive late to the event?\r\nA: We have a tight schedule to follow. Do arrive on time.\r\nQ: Is there a dress code?\r\nA: Neat fitting, trendy attire is good. No athletic shoes, hoodies, shorts, flip flops, tank tops, or baseball caps. PCNY is not responsible for denied admissions due to inappropriate attire.\r\nQ: What kind of free drinks\/specials do we get?\r\n\r\nA: We receive exclusive \"pub crawl only\" drink deals that vary by location such as: complimentary drinks, a free shot with your drink, and buy one get one free drinks!\r\nQ: Is there an age restriction?\r\nA: You must be 21+ to enjoy this night out. Do bring ID, even if you are 100 years old haha. Laws regarding ID's are very strict here.\r\nQ: What is your cancellation policy?\r\nA: Cancellations must be made no later than 48 hours prior to the event in order to be eligible for transfer or refund.

One of the main driving forces behind the club\u2019s musical aesthetic, his Saturday night residency there and its forward-thinking programming propelled the club itself and him alongside it to legendary status. Craig was never one to hog the spotlight at fabric or elsewhere, releasing a slim, highly-regarded discography either as Tyrant with Lee Burridge or later solo, and the abrupt end of the institution calls many things into question for London and for him personally. The Selector\u2019s and House of Yes proudly welcome him back for a rare New York appearance in the demonstration of solidarity and in full faith that he will deliver the highest possible standard of excellence, as he has done everywhere his work was celebrated, just as it was at fabric at BlkMarket Memberships\u2019 The Nothing Special events. Some may remember the sweatbox party last year with Fred P. and Norm Talley we had with Nicolas Lutz; he is one of a rare breed of DJs whose style centers around the art of the chase: seeking the perfect record, mixed perfectly. Like Craig Richards, Dan Bell or Club der Visionaere compatriot Binh, Lutz\u2019s sets are studied affairs stitched seamlessly together that gain rapturous praise from heads while keeping the dancefloor alive in motion, and his unusual ear extends to his label My Own Jupiter. In the next room, House on Mute\u2019s established curator and resident Cry Baby will share the booth with The Selectors\u2019 Taimur Agha for a rare pairing. \u2018Nothing Gold Can Stay,\u2019 presented by The Selectors and House of Yes, is a celebration of the impermanence of things and the new discoveries gained by moving forwards.

Every Tuesday through Sunday this magnificent vessel gives you the chance to hope aboard and sail past some of the most memorable landmarks that the Big Apple has to offer. From the Manhattan, Williamsburg and Brooklyn Bridges, to South Street Seaport, Lower Manhattan, and the Freedom Tower, you'll have a chance to take all of these sites in as you cruise by. Last but certainly not least, will be the gorgeous Statue of Liberty, what's considered to be one of the top landmarks in the country. A live DJ will be supplying music to the all-ages crowd on board, so there will be some sounds that accompany the scenery. Presented by OnCruises.com, this voyage that departs from Pier 15 also features a full bar for the adults, so thirsts will be quenched!

A state of the art sound system, dance floors, fully stocked bars where you can order your favorite cocktails, and a live DJ spinning the top tracks to keep the vibe at the party alive for hours on end, those are just some of the things that you can look forward to.
